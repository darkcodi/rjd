//! Path filtering and manipulation utilities
//!
//! This module provides utilities for working with JSON paths.
//!
//! **Note**: After optimization in Task 6, the legacy path manipulation functions
//! have been removed in favor of PathParser and single-pass traversal.

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // Tests removed along with unused functions
    // PathParser is now tested in path_parser.rs
    // AfterFormatter is tested in after.rs
}
